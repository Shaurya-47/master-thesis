 The following DGCNN model implementation is used to extract the hidden layer network activations : https://github.com/AnTao97/dgcnn.pytorch

 Replace the main_partseg.py file from the repository listed above with the hidden_layer_extraction.py file from this repository. Thereafter, follow the instructions for the part segmentation scenario provided in https://github.com/AnTao97/dgcnn.pytorch in order to extract the hidden layer information under the part segmentation scenario (ShapeNet Part dataset).
